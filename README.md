## Philosophy

Built on two foundational principles:

1. **Time Scarcity Creates Intentionality**: When you remember your days are numbered, every studio session becomes precious.

2. **The Big Questions Drive Better Work**: Instead of just tracking what you made, we ask why it matters - transforming craft into purpose.

The app integrates Viktor Frankl's logotherapy throughout, helping makers connect daily studio work to larger questions of meaning and purpose.
